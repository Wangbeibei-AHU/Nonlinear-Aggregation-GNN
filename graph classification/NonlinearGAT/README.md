A  baseline implementation of Nonlinear Aggergation based GAT model for graph classification task:

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.7)
- PyTorch (>=1.8.1)

## Introduction
In this repo, we provide our code with the MUTAG, PTC-MR and PROTEINS datasets as example. The GAT model used in this code is provided by Graph Attention Networks (Veličković et al., ICLR 2018).

## Examples
The commands for running the codes as collected in /scripts.
