A  baseline implementation of Nonlinear Aggergation based GCN model for graph classification task:

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.7)
- PyTorch (>=1.8.1)
- Cogdl (0.5.2) 
# To better run our codes, we slightly revised some functions in cogdl. Please use our provided cogdl directory as the cogdl library.

## Introduction
In this repo, we provide our code with the MUTAG, PTC-MR and PROTEINS datasets as example. The GCN model used in this code is provided by Thomas N. Kipf, Max Welling, Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks (ICLR 2017).

## Examples
The commands for running the codes as collected in /scripts.
