A baseline implementation of Nonlinear Aggergation based GCN model for node classification task.

## Requirements
- Python>=3.7
- PyTorch (>=1.8.1)

## Introduction
In this repo, we provide our code with the citation datasets as example. The GCN model used in this code is provided by Thomas N. Kipf, Max Welling, Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks (ICLR 2017).

## Examples
Here are the instruction commands for running the codes.
* Command
```
python main.py --dataset cora --aggtype Generalized-mean
```
