A baseline implementation of Nonlinear Aggergation based GAT model for node classification task.

## Requirements
- Python>=3.7
- PyTorch (>=1.8.1)
- DGL (0.7.2)

## Introduction
In this repo, we provide our code with the citation datasets as example. The GAT model used in this code is provided by Graph Attention Networks (Veličković et al., ICLR 2018).

## Examples
Here are the instruction commands for running the codes.
* Command
```
python main.py --dataset cora --aggtype Generalized-mean
```
